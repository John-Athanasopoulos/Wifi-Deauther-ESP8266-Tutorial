# Wifi-Deauther-ESP8266
A tutorial on how to make a Wifi Deauther (with beacon and probe attacks included) with an ESP8266 board!

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my tutorial on how to make a Wifi Deauther with a simple ESP8266 board. There are a lot of tutorials on the internet,
but I realised that all of them either weren't very clear, or lacked some information needed (at least for me). That's the main reason why
I decided that I should make my tutorial on the Wifi Deauther, having collected all the information in one place and trying to make the
instructions simple and short. You can navigate to the sections of the tutorial clicking on the following links:
